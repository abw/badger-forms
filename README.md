# Badger Forms

This implements functionality for server-side validation of web
forms using Node.js.

It is a Javascript port of an old Perl library, written to help
migrate some old code bases to Javascript.  It is not recommended
for new projects.

It is currently pre-alpha and should be considered *highly unstable*.
